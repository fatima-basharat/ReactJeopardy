## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would love to add more animations such as for each time a card is flipped.


## Installation

To get started, clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/fatima-basharat/ReactJeopardy.git
```

Install the NPM packages

```
npm install
```

## Usage

run this command in one terminal

```
npm run server
```

run this command in another terminal

Once the server is running, go to [_http://localhost:5173_](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.


## Lessons Learned:

I used Vite for the first time and learned how efficient this tool is in starting new projects. Super glad I tried it out, I'll definitely keep using it in the future.
